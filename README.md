Creative Project #2 for CS 260

This project uses the Face++ API to detect facial moods and evaluate gender, age, and ethnicity (only determines Black, White, Indian, and Asian at the moment) from an image.

You can easily use it and have 5 faces analyzed in one image by entering a url to an image or uploading an image from your device.
